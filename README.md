## Description

The back end for an e-commerce site configured using a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. This uses the latest technoligies so that a company can compete in the ever evolving world. This has multiple features. The schema is used to create the database. Seeds folder is used to seed data to the database. The models are created to set up the objects in the database. The routes connect the pages and the database. And lastly we have the connection which launches the page. This uses the "dotenv" to make a secure login without displaying the username or password for mysql. This can be seen in following image:
